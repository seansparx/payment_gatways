If it were me, I would:

1.    Create a customer object on each pledge via Stripe API.

2.    Create a card object on each pledge, attach to a customer, also via Stripe API.

3.    Store in your local DB a record identifying the customer and card object in Stripe, and relating it to the campaign. Add a column "has_been_charged" (BOOL) = 0 (false). Add column "has_been_deleted" (BOOL) = 0 (false).

4.    On campaign completion, verify campaign success.

5.    If successful, loop through each DB record WHERE has_been_charged = 0 AND campaign_id = the campaign. Do this in blocks of 100 or 500 or 1000 depenending on DB connectivity and time it takes to loop through.

5a. During loop, retrieve card/customer object via Stripe API, create charge via Stripe API, update database column has_been_charged = 1.

5b. Repeat loop until all charges are completed.

    If unsuccessful, loop through each DB record WHERE has_been_deleted = 0 AND campaign_id = the campaign Again, do this in blocks.

6a. During loop, remove card object via Stripe API (and perhaps also customer object), also update database column has_been_deleted = 1.

6b. Repeat loop until all cards have been removed.
